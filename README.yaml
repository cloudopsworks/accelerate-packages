# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `accelerate` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.
  It's designed to work with CI/CD systems such as GitHub Actions, Codefresh, Travis CI, CircleCI and Jenkins.

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .accelerate "https://cowk.io/accelerate"; echo .accelerate)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.accelerate` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.accelerate` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names

  ## GitHub Actions
  
  The `accelerate` is compatible with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

  Here's an example of running `make readme/lint` 

  ```
  name: accelerate/readme/lint
  on: [pull_request]
  jobs:
    build:
      name: 'Lint README.md'
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - uses: cloudopsworks/accelerate@master
        with:
          entrypoint: /usr/bin/make
          args: readme/lint
   ```

# Example usage
# examples: |-
#   Here are some real world examples:
#   - [`github-authorized-keys`](https://github.com/cloudopsworks/github-authorized-keys/) - A Golang project that leverages `docker/%`, `go/%`, `travis/%` targets
#   - [`charts`](https://github.com/cloudopsworks/charts/) - A collection of Helm Charts that leverages `docker/%` and `helm/%` targets
#   - [`bastion`](https://github.com/cloudopsworks/bastion/) - A docker image that leverages `docker/%` and `bash/lint` targets
#   - [`terraform-null-label`](https://github.com/cloudopsworks/terraform-null-label/) - A terraform module that leverages `terraform/%` targets
